Q1) Identify FRs and NFRs:

Functional Requirements:

→ Authentication: This ensures that the system verifies the user exists using email verification.
→ New User Registration: This is for anyone who wants to register in the system to access it.
→ User Login: This is for existing registered users to login into their account.
→ Member Registration: This feature is for random registered users to be a member of the system to avail some special privileges like issuing a book.
→ Random User Access: This is for those who are the existing users of the system but not members so they can just search or browse the system.
→ Issue Book: This feature is only for members and not users, who want to borrow a book from the system. They are able to borrow, reissue, and extend the date of return if available free.
→ Search Book: This feature allows all the users to search books online. It is not necessary to be a member to search for books.
→ Staff Access: The library staff can look upon the records of day to day book issuing.
→ Security: The password of every user is encrypted.
→ Librarian Access: The librarian has complete control over the system, can enter a new record into the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is taken off the system.

Non-Functional Requirements:

→ Performance: The system should be able to handle multiple user requests at same time and accurately
→ Reliability: The system should ensure that the information it provides to the users is correct and should have fast recovery in terms of failure.
→ Usability: The system should have a good user interface to engage users and make them easily understand the interface.
→ Security: It should run only within the institute LAN.
→ Scalability: In future in case the registrations increase, it should be able to handle it efficiently. 
→ Maintainability: The system should be able to maintain and update the database regularly. 

Q2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects

Scope: The scope of this is to develop a working mobile application that helps people suffering from hearing loss. This application would identify different sounds or noise around  the system and prevent any danger the user might face by displaying it in the application. Thus it meets the requirement of developing this application.

Features: 
→ Low latency in real time usage.
→ Identifies surrounding sound and noise such as honking 
→ Alerts the user from danger occuring by vibrations or displaying on the app.
→ Available in Android devices.
→ Continual logging of sound events.

Non-functional aspects:
→ Performance: Works efficiently in real-time with less latency
→ Usability: Good interface and accessible for people with hearing loss.
→ Security: Protect data of registered users.
→ Reliability: Must provide accurate information and should not misguide the users from false alarms.
→ Scalability: Concurrent and accurate information must be provided to all the users even if the users increase in future.
